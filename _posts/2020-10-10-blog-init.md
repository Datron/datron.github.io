I started this blog to put the ideas and thoughts that I have into words so that I can better analyse them. When I have to write about them, the fear of having people read the garbage I put out will probably force me to research more, and in the process I end up learning something. If I'm wrong, future me (and possibly a lot of people) can always come back to the idea and see where I went wrong. By writing, I hope to get better at communicating ideas to people through text. I also want to track my thought progress, what assumptions I made at the time when building something, and why they were right or wrong. Maybe you can learn something too, hindsight is always helpful.

I promise to keep the content honest, only editing older posts when something has become offensive or no longer adds meaning to the post. I will try to add references. I don't plan to have a word count, some essays will be long and others will be short. My interests will change over time, so please don't be suprised when you see a post about woodwork or soldering.

Also this is evidence to recruiters that I can at the minimum enter Jekyll commands into a terminal. That counts for something right? (pls hire)
